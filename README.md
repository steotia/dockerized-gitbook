# Inspiration

There are lots of good stuff floating around on the Internet. This book is a collation of various recipes, articles and ideas into a exercise driven approach to understanding Docker. It also cross links to best practices, great tools I have found and the scope should grow to include various Docker orchestration frameworks.

Personally, it captures my journey from just knowing Docker as an enthusiast to using Docker in Production and sharing the various highs and lows experienced.

This book is 'just-enough'. If you feel, that it is missing an important detail or has a defect, feel free to contribute. If I get enough bandwidth, I will try to accommodate a section for 'deep-dive'.

# Pre-requisites

You need to have Docker 17.06.2-ce \(Community Edition\) installed.
